<p>
In this module I add small snippets that are released for public.
You shouldn't use the whole module as it is, cause the build has a pretty old and not perfect setup and the functions don't have any relation to each other. Just extrat the functions you need and add them to your own modules.
<br/>  
  <b>Currently added functions:</b>
  <ul>
    <li><div>SVG-Viewer  <span style="color:red">(Deprecated)</span> : Contains a StoreListener that adds a preview-image to SVG-files on creation/change and a toolbar-plugins that allows to show a preview of the svg in a swing-dialog (SiteArchitect only)</div><br/>
      <div style="color:red">You should change the StoreListener to a ploadHook or server-side StoreListener and provide a preview-function for ContentCreator instead of the Swing-Dialog.</div></li>
    <li>ProjectGroups-Hotspot: A hotspot for Option-based gom-elements that provides the groups of the current project</li>
  </ul>
</p>
